    "Introduction\n",
    "----------\n",
    "When targeting near term devices, compilers are most concerned about transforming circuits so that successful execution is maxized while conforming to the underlying machine's physical constraints. Typically this means that circuits are optimized to use as few multi-qudit gates as possible, requires that circuits be transpiled to a particular gate set, and demands mapping to a restrictive topology. BQSKit provides techniques for addressing each of these aspects of the compilation pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fault tolerant computation poses different challenges. Unlike in the NISQ case, FT compilation assumes that robust error corrected qubits store information. This feat is accomplished by adding a new layer to the quantum computing stack: a quantum error correcting code [3, 4, 5]. This new protection does not come for free. For codes of interest, implementing arbitrary unitary operations on logical qubits becomes much more difficult. This is because these code admit restrictive discrete gate sets, whereas physical qubits can be made to implement continuous rotations. To make matters worse, only a subset of the logical gates needed for universal computation can be easily implemented. These gates are in the Clifford group (generated by $\\{H, S, CNOT\\}$), which contains some familiar faces such as the Pauli matrices ($\\{X, Y, Z\\}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our logical gate set universal, we need to add a single non-Clifford gate to the mix [6]. The most popular non-Clifford gate considered is the $T$ gate, which we define as \n",
    "$$\n",
    "T = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Even though we can't implement the $T$ gate directly like we can Clifford gates, teleportation lets us inject special resource states into our circuit that can be used to implement non-Clifford gates. We can prepare these special \"magic\" states using a process called magic state distillation [7]. Because there is so much that must happen behind the scenes to make sure that non-Clifford gates can be executed, they are typically $100$-$1000\\times$ more expensive to implement than their Clifford cousins. This marks a huge departure from the optimization objective in NISQ-centric synthesis algorithms. Whereas before the primary concern was minimizing multi-qubit gates (such as $CNOT$), now the goal is to minimize non-Clifford gates (such as $T$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can consider the single-qubit Clifford+$T$ gate set, which is simply $\\{H, T\\}$ (note that $T^2=S$ and $T^4=Z$). Equipped with this gate set, the Solovay-Kitaev theorem tells us that we can implement an approximation of any single-qubit unitary up to a precision of $\\epsilon$ in $O(log^{3.97}(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}))$ gates. Along with the $CNOT$ gate, this gives us the ability to approximate any $n$-qubit operation in a fault tolerant way!"
